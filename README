                            ====================

    SIM Nuts'n'Bolts is an extension library for Coin that contains
    various nuts and bolts that are useful for creating generic Coin-
    based visualization applications.  The nodes are in general viewer-
    centric in scope.  You won't find domain-specific nodes for any
    particular engineering domain here - such nodes will have to go into
    another library.

    The library was first released in early 2005, but some of the nodes
    it contains has been living in the SmallChange library for years
    and been in use in various projects.  The unversioned/unreleased
    state of SmallChange has however been a problem, so to make the
    nodes more useful and usable, a new strict library was split out.
