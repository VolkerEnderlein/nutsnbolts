                        SIM Nuts'n'Bolts 0.1
                        ====================

SIM Nuts'n'Bolts is an extension library for Coin that contains
various nuts and bolts that are useful for creating generic Coin-
based visualization applications.  The nodes are in general viewer-
centric in scope.  You won't find domain-specific nodes for any
particular engineering domain here - such nodes will go to other
libraries.

The library was first released in early 2005, but some of the code
it contains has been living in the SmallChange library for years
and been in use in various projects.  The unversioned/unreleased
state of SmallChange has however been a problem, so to make the
nodes more useful and usable, a new strict library was split out.
