Nuts'n'Bolts
============

Description
-----------

SIM Nuts'n'Bolts is an extension library for [Coin](https://github.com/coin3d/coin)
that contains various nuts and bolts that are useful for creating
generic Coin-based visualization applications.  The nodes are in
general viewer-centric in scope.  You won't find domain-specific
nodes for any particular engineering domain here - such nodes will
go to other libraries.

The library was first released in early 2005, but some of the code
it contains has been living in the SmallChange library for years
and been in use in various projects.  The unversioned/unreleased
state of SmallChange has however been a problem, so to make the
nodes more useful and usable, a new strict library was split out.
